============

G-Code syntax highlighting for Notepad ++ with UDL2.0

To install this syntax highlighter:

- Make sure you have the latest [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) installed to use the new user defined languages.
- Clone this repository or just download the [_gcode.xml_](https://github.com/foreachthing/gcode-syntax/blob/master/gcode.xml)  and/or [_gcode-zenburn.xml_](https://github.com/foreachthing/gcode-syntax/blob/master/gcode-zenburn.xml) file (that's all you need).
- In Notepad++, go to the "Language"->"Define Your Language..." dialog.
- Click "Import", then browse to the downloaded _*.xml_ file. If you see "Import was successful", then the G Code syntax highlighter is installed.
