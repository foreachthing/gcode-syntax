gcode-syntax
============

G-Code syntax highlighting for Notepad ++ with UDL2.0

To install this syntax highlighter:

- Make sure you have installed [notepad++ 6.x.x](http://download.tuxfamily.org/notepadplus/6.4.2/npp.6.4.2.Installer.exe) to use the new user defined languages
- Clone this repository or just download the [_gcode.xml_](https://github.com/foreachthing/gcode-syntax/blob/master/gcode.xml)  and/or [_gcode-zenburn.xml_](https://github.com/foreachthing/gcode-syntax/blob/master/gcode-zenburn.xml) file (that's all you need)
- In Notepad++, go to the "Language"->"Define Your Language..." dialog
- Click "Import", then browse to the downloaded _gcode.xml_ file. If you see "Import was successful", then the G Code syntax highlighter is installed.

- Added more M- and G-Codes for 3D-Printing for the Ultimaker 2, sliced with Cura and Craftware.
